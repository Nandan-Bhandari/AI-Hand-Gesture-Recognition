# AI-HansPose-Detection
In this Project I've implemented algorithms of OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries using Python Programming language.
First of all, there is a Hand_Landmark image which will enumerate the dots of the joining lines between nodes or you can say the number of nodes.
Secondly, I've created a normal model, which only scan your hand and implement the model in real time.
And finally, I've created a model that will scan your hand in real time, as well as take snaps of each and every movement in an approximate speed of 10 snaps per second.
